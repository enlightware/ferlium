# Contributing to Ferlium

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in Ferlium.
Before contributing, please review the guidelines below.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contributions, you need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/stephanemagnenat/687894020a6df8d9e1ebda4514987abe).
The CLA clarifies the intellectual property rights for contributions from individuals or entities.

To ensure every developer has signed the CLA, we use [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/), an open source tool which ensures that a contributor has signed the CLA before allowing a pull request to be merged.
Once signed, you won't need to do this again unless the CLA changes.

When you submit a pull request for the first time, CLA Assistant will ask you to sign the CLA:
1. When the pull request performs the standard checks, you will see that the `license/cla` check has run, and requests users to sign the CLA.
2. Click "**Details**", and you will be directed to the CLA Assistant tool, where you can read the CLA, fill out the required personal details, and sign it.
3. Once you have clicked "**I agree**", navigate back to the Pull request, and see that the CLA Assistant check has passed.
