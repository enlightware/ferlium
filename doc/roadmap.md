# Roadmap

### Language features

- Loops
- Record types
- Effects
- Type classes
- Co-routine/async
- Algebraic data types
- Generalised match
- Object-oriented style function calls
- Early return

### Library and test features

- Array map
- Array from iterator (note: functional iterators require closures)

### Compiler features

- Just in time compilation

### Next tasks

- Fix bugs
- Borrow checker
- Fix grammar with equal in lambdas
- Do not add trivial constraints to type inference
